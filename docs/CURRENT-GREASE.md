# Current Grease

This document preserves the reconciliation of the August 2026 conversation history with Grease, the Grease branches of Oils, and the later `ish` / Odriç split. Its branch heads and receipt hashes below are historical snapshots, not a live source inventory. Current repositories are [`dilapidated-shed/grease`](https://github.com/dilapidated-shed/grease) and [`dilapidated-shed/oils`](https://github.com/dilapidated-shed/oils); older identities remain in the historical record.

It is intentionally narrower than a language design document. A branch name is not treated as a decision, and an old experiment is not promoted merely because it exists.

## Current model

Grease is the working Oils/YSH-derived shell-language line. Oils/YSH behavior remains the inherited reference unless Grease deliberately changes it.

The current source pin is the top-level `source/` gitlink, checked by the [receipt workflow](../.github/workflows/grease-receipt.yml). Later implementation includes [native libc actions](NATIVE-LIBC.md), the [sensor command](../commands/sensors/README.md), and the [accelerometer inspection consumer](../examples/accelerometer-inspection.ysh). These additions do not retroactively extend any old receipt's scope.

The original reconciled Grease-specific language change was readable boolean syntax:

- `⟦ ... ⟧` enters the inherited `[[ ... ]]` condition path;
- `∧` uses the inherited `&&` token path;
- `∨` uses the inherited `||` token path;
- `¬` uses the inherited `!` token path.

These spellings are lexer-level aliases in the present implementation, not a new independent semantic layer. They are separated operators: quoted glyphs stay literal, and a glyph glued into an ordinary word is not promised to behave like punctuation with shell-specific whitespace rules.

Grease also carries three conservative runtime/startup cleanups that remove work when the corresponding feature is disabled. They do not define new language semantics.

`ish` is now the intended new shell written in Odriç. It descends from the experience of Oils/YSH and Grease but does not inherit a compatibility contract. Grease therefore remains useful as the executable/reference predecessor and as an oracle for shell behavior while `ish` grows feature by feature. The plan to make Grease itself become the new Odriç-written shell is superseded by the separate `ish` line.

## Reconciliation decision ledger

`CURRENT` below records decisions retained from that reconciliation; the exact source and branch heads are historical provenance. Later additions are linked above.

| Class | Decision | Provenance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CURRENT | Grease remains Oils/YSH-derived rather than a from-scratch shell. | Repository source is a submodule of `isomorphisms/oils`; current implementation line is `oils:grease/main`. |
| CURRENT | `⟦ ... ⟧`, `∧`, `∨`, `¬` are Grease-readable spellings for inherited boolean token paths. | `isomorphisms/oils` PR #1, merged as `8052868773077602266d80bf39aad6998e2da749`, with focused spec coverage. |
| CURRENT | Remove dead completion timing, disabled debug construction, and disabled multi-trace argv accounting. | Integrated line `7d5a723` -> `4ab053f` -> `e9a54ad`; all are ancestors of `grease/main`. |
| CURRENT | `ish` is the separate descendant to be written in Odriç; Grease is a predecessor/reference, not the Odriç implementation itself. | `isomorphisms/grease:ish` commits `78ffc75` and `00160a3`; Odriç begins at `isomorphisms/Idric:Odriç` commit `0476044`. |
| SUPERSEDED | Evolving Grease itself into the Idriç/Odriç-written future shell. | The later `ish` branch explicitly assigns that role to `ish` and says compatibility with Grease/Oils/YSH is reference material rather than a contract. |
| EXPERIMENTAL | Ithon/Python migration work using `←`, `→`, `×`, `÷`, and `λ` / `ƒ`. | Recovered Ithon experiment treated the migration as a separate compatibility project and rejected mechanical glyph replacement such as rewriting `*args` / `**kwargs`. It never became the current Oils Grease implementation. |
| EXPERIMENTAL | ICKY as a Grease parser bridge. | Recovered parser experiment kept ICKY syntax-only: preserve glyphs/source order, do not assign Grease meaning or precedence. It was not integrated into `oils:grease/main`. |
| UNDECIDED | Whether the Ithon spellings `←`, `→`, `×`, `÷`, and `λ` / `ƒ` should still be added to Oils-derived Grease. | The experiment established useful spellings, but the later `ish` / Odriç split changed the implementation roadmap without a conversation decision that ports these spellings into current Grease. `λ` versus `ƒ` also remained an alternative. |
| UNDECIDED | Environment-cache, direct command-substitution slurp, control-flow-result, lazy grammar/builtin/readline/history, LTO, regex caching, and getline-buffer ideas. | The corresponding branches were created as independent experiments from the Oils reference commit but contain no implementation, and recovered conversation history does not record a final semantic or performance decision. |

## Python / Ithon boundary

The old Oils machinery on this fork is Python-2-era. The recovered Ithon work explicitly treated moving that machinery to current Ithon/CPython as a compatibility migration, not a glyph-only rewrite. Mechanical replacement of `*` was rejected because multiplication, `*args`, `**kwargs`, unpacking, and other uses are not the same construct.

A lowered Ithon smoke using `←`, `→`, `×`, and `λ` executed and printed `grease:ithon:42`, but native Ithon execution was unavailable because no built `ithon` executable existed. That is useful experiment evidence, not a receipt for current Oils-derived Grease.

After the `ish` split, completing this migration is not a prerequisite for the new shell: Odriç owns the new native implementation path. The experiment may still inform readable syntax, but it is not current Grease semantics by default.

## ICKY boundary

ICKY was explored as a parser front end only. Its job was to retain glyph identity and source order. Meaning and precedence remained downstream language decisions. The experiment therefore does not justify claiming that ICKY owns Grease semantics or that every glyph in its vocabulary belongs to Grease.

The recovered ICKY build remained blocked by unavailable `idris2`, so there is no current executable ICKY receipt to promote.

| `grease/main` | `8052868` | Current Oils-derived Grease implementation: quick wins plus readable boolean syntax. |

The ten label-only idea branches are not latent commits waiting to be merged. No implementation exists on them beyond the baseline. They should remain historical/undecided evidence unless a later decision turns one into a real issue.

## Top-level Grease archaeology

Before this convergence pass, `isomorphisms/grease:main` was still pinned to Oils commit `e9a54ad`, even though `oils:grease/main` had advanced to `8052868`. The convergence branch corrects that reproducibility mismatch.

Other top-level branches are deliberately not folded into current Grease:

- `source-layout` is the merged head of Grease PR #1 and is historical after merge;
- `ish` is two commits ahead of the old main and contains the successor-language design, `odric.lock`, and the one-command native milestone;
- `sms-server-filesystem-foundation` is unrelated application/service work and is outside Grease language convergence.

## `ish` / Odriç boundary

The `ish` branch says explicitly that `ish` inherits experience and examples from Grease/YSH/Oils without a compatibility contract. Its first native milestone is one parsed simple command becoming one process with exact argv and status through direct `execve`; quoting, variables, command substitution, pipelines, conditions, loops, builtins, and job control are deliberately later work.

The branch locks Odriç to `isomorphisms/Idric` branch `Odriç`, revision `0476044583fc8aef897cefeaeb1d0f2e976f3230`, whose commit message is `Begin Odriç as ish co-design line`.

This gives a clean responsibility split:

- Grease: working Oils/YSH-derived shell, readable Grease aliases, inherited shell behavior, and reference/oracle value;
- `ish`: the new shell whose features are pulled into existence by small real programs;
- Odriç: the native language/compiler line co-designed with `ish`.

## Executable receipts (historical scope)

### Canonical pinned current Grease source

The first top-level receipt was accidentally green. PR #3 run `33708983086` and the corresponding `main` run `33763895003` both checked out `source/` at `8052868`, but the inherited container mounted the submodule worktree without the parent repository's `.git/modules/source` directory. `soil/worker.sh` stopped at `fatal: not a git repository` before running any `cpp-spec` task. The surrounding Oils wrapper did not propagate that early failure, so neither run is executable evidence.

The repaired `.github/workflows/grease-receipt.yml` first performs a normal recursive-submodule checkout and verifies that `source/` matches the top-level gitlink. It then checks out that exact revision as a standalone worktree, which the inherited container harness can mount without losing git metadata. After running `soil/github-actions.sh run-job cpp-spec podman`, the workflow checks both the commit recorded inside the container and the task status recorded by the Oils harness. A missing task record, a different source revision, or any failing `cpp-spec` task therefore makes the receipt fail.

This is the canonical receipt contract for the reconciled source pin. It does not replace Oils/YSH as the wider behavioral oracle; it makes that oracle reproducible from the Grease repository itself.

### PASS — readable Grease boolean syntax

The code-bearing `grease/readable-tests` head `ac8d766` ran GitHub Actions run `32572974720`. In the `cpp-spec` job, the substantive `cpp-spec` step completed successfully. The job became red only in the later `publish-html` step.

The tested head and merged `grease/main` commit `8052868` have identical blobs for the Grease lexer (`frontend/lexer_def.py`, blob `3bb10cff589df52772638e80b85c892a05b738a8`) and focused Grease spec (`spec/grease-readable-operators.test.sh`, blob `0ec3f74e398e8cae28697ab3ffe0400f357ccd9c`). The executable result therefore applies to the current implementation content for this feature.

The focused spec exercises condition brackets, conjunction, disjunction, negation in command and condition contexts, and quoted literal glyphs.

### PASS — integrated quick wins

Recovered test records for the quick-wins work reported structural checks passing, and the three commits are ancestors of current `grease/main`. These changes remove disabled/dead work rather than alter language results.

### PASS / SKIP — Ithon migration experiment

PASS: the lowered Ithon smoke executed and printed `grease:ithon:42`.

SKIP: native Ithon execution was unavailable because no built `ithon` executable existed. This is experiment evidence, not the current Grease runtime.

### SKIP — ICKY bridge

No current executable receipt is claimed. The recovered environment lacked `idris2`, and the ICKY bridge was never integrated into `oils:grease/main`.

### FAIL — historical publishing infrastructure, not Grease semantics

The older readable-syntax Actions run is globally red because `publish-html` failed after substantive jobs such as `cpp-spec` had passed. The repaired top-level receipt deliberately omits that unrelated publishing step and verifies the recorded `cpp-spec` task status directly. Do not treat the old publisher failure as a language-test failure.

## Non-blocking design questions

These are possible later language decisions, not evidence of unfinished Grease work and not prerequisites for leaving the present implementation stationary.

1. Should any of `←`, `→`, `×`, `÷`, `λ`, or `ƒ` be implemented in Oils-derived Grease now, or should those experiments survive only as design input to `ish` / Odriç?
2. If anonymous-function notation remains relevant to Grease, is the spelling `λ`, `ƒ`, both, or neither?
3. Are any of the ten unimplemented performance/runtime idea branches still wanted strongly enough to become real issues? Conversation history does not currently distinguish them from archived experiments.
4. How much new behavior should Grease receive after the split, beyond maintaining a useful executable/reference shell while `ish` catches up? The evidence establishes the roles but not a feature-freeze policy.

## Resting-state policy

Grease does not need a specially branded executable or another language/runtime pass merely to make the repository look more complete. The inherited Oils/YSH build and invocation paths are the implementation, and the exact pinned source plus the top-level receipt are the reproducible handoff.

Reopen Grease development for a concrete correctness or reproducibility failure, a security problem that affects the pinned implementation, or a deliberate new Grease language decision. Upstream Oils development, the existence of old idea branches, and possible improvements by themselves do not require Grease to move.
