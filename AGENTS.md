# Agent instructions

Apply the shared evidence and acceptance guardrails in
`isomorphisms/ai-ci/AGENTS.md`. Before changing Grease, read
[`docs/CURRENT-GREASE.md`](docs/CURRENT-GREASE.md) for the language boundary and
historical reconciliation, and the README for current implementation entry points.

## Do not promote archaeology into current design

A branch name, label-only idea branch, old experiment, or earlier roadmap is not
by itself a current decision. Do not manufacture missing implementation from an
experiment branch or promote it merely because it exists.

Current Grease is the Oils/YSH-derived line pinned through this repository's
`source/` submodule. `ish`/Odriç is a separate successor line. Ithon and ICKY
experiments are evidence and design input, not current Grease semantics unless a
later explicit decision promotes them.

## Do not masquerade another runtime as Grease

Do not call Bash, POSIX shell, Python/Ithon, a lowered smoke, or a wrapper around
another implementation a Grease execution receipt.

A Grease receipt must identify the exact source revision and exercise the
current Grease/Oils/YSH implementation that is being claimed. If the required
runtime is unavailable, report that boundary as unverified rather than
substituting a familiar shell or interpreter.

## Native, raw, and physical terminology

Use `native` for the target platform's own lowest useful semantic/system
interface for the facility being used. On Linux that can be libc or the kernel
system-call boundary; on Android it can be DEX/ART, JNI/NDK/Bionic,
Binder/platform services, or a direct device/event interface such as touch or
swipe. The useful native boundary depends on the task.

Do not use `native` as a synonym for C++ or MyCPP. C++ may implement a bridge
to a native platform interface, but it is an implementation language/layer, not
the meaning of native.

Use `raw` when deliberately dropping below the ordinary native interface into
assembly, machine instructions, registers, instruction encodings, low-level
bus/protocol bytes or signaling, and similar machine-facing representation.
Use `physical`, `circuit`, or `electrical` for actual gates, transistors,
voltages, current, capacitance, traces, and other physical electronics.

Do not force shell/application semantics to descend into raw or physical detail
when the platform already exposes the useful operation directly. Keep those
lower layers inspectable when a task specifically requires them.

## Preserve exact source provenance

Treat the `source/` submodule revision as material provenance. A successful run
against another Oils revision, an old experiment, or a different pin is
historical evidence only.

Read the current pin from the gitlink; do not duplicate it as a moving "current"
hash in prose. Keep exact hashes in historical receipts scoped to their own runs.

Keep semantic tests distinct from unrelated publishing/infrastructure stages; a
publisher failure does not retroactively make a passed language test fail, and
a language-test pass does not prove later packaging or publishing stages.
