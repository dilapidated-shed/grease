# grease

A language to smooth the friction between things that come in contact with one another ("shell"), based on Oils/YSH and thickened with Grease-specific changes.

Grease is currently the working Oils/YSH-derived implementation and reference predecessor to `ish`. `ish` is a separate descendant intended to be written in Odriç; it is not a rename of this source tree and it does not make Grease depend on Odriç.

See [`docs/CURRENT-GREASE.md`](docs/CURRENT-GREASE.md) for the reconciled language state, branch archaeology, superseded experiments, and executable receipts.

## Source

The Grease implementation is pinned under `source/` as a git submodule. It points at the `grease/main` line of `isomorphisms/oils`, currently commit `8052868773077602266d80bf39aad6998e2da749`.

Clone with submodules to obtain the complete source tree:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/isomorphisms/grease.git
```

Keeping the Oils-derived tree as a pinned submodule avoids copying the full upstream repository while giving Grease one stable, reproducible source location for CI and local builds.


## Vast.ai

`commands/vast/vast.ysh` gives Grease a thin REST hook for Vast.ai GPU
compute. It covers offer search and the core instance lifecycle without making
Grease depend on Vast's Python SDK. The repository receipt exercises the actual
pinned Grease/YSH runtime against an HTTP fixture; see
[`commands/vast/README.md`](commands/vast/README.md).
